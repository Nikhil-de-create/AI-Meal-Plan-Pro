# AI Meal Assistant

## Overview

This is a full-stack meal planning application built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. The application allows users to create personalized meal plans, manage dietary preferences, browse recipes, and generate grocery lists. The system leverages AI-powered meal plan generation using OpenAI's API to create customized meal suggestions based on user preferences and dietary requirements.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client, server, and mobile code:

- **Frontend (Web)**: React with TypeScript, Vite for bundling, Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Mobile App**: React Native with Expo, TypeScript, React Navigation for routing
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, RESTful API architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt for password hashing
- **External Services**: OpenAI API for AI-powered meal plan generation
- **Development Environment**: Replit with hot reload and live development features

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with middleware-based route protection
- **File Structure**: Modular approach with separate routes, middleware, and services

### Mobile App Architecture

- **State Management**: React Context for authentication, HTTP client for API calls
- **UI Components**: Native React Native components with custom styling
- **Authentication**: JWT token storage using Expo SecureStore
- **API Integration**: Axios-based HTTP client with request/response interceptors

### Database Schema
The database uses PostgreSQL with the following main entities:
- **Users**: Core user authentication and profile data
- **User Preferences**: Dietary restrictions, allergies, cuisine preferences, cooking preferences
- **Meal Plans**: Generated meal plans with associated meals and metadata
- **Recipes**: Recipe data with ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information
- **Grocery Lists**: Generated shopping lists based on meal plans
- **User Favorites**: User's favorite recipes and meal plans

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication system
- Protected routes using authentication middleware
- Token-based session management with 7-day expiration
- Password hashing using bcryptjs

### AI Integration
- OpenAI GPT-4 integration for meal plan generation
- Customizable meal plans based on user preferences
- Support for dietary restrictions, allergies, and cuisine preferences
- Nutritional information generation

## Data Flow

### Web Application
1. **User Registration/Login**: Users authenticate through JWT tokens stored in localStorage
2. **Preference Management**: Users set dietary preferences, restrictions, and cooking preferences
3. **Meal Plan Generation**: AI generates personalized meal plans based on user preferences
4. **Recipe Management**: Users can browse, search, and favorite recipes
5. **Grocery List Generation**: Automatic grocery list creation from meal plan ingredients
6. **Data Persistence**: All user data, preferences, and generated content stored in PostgreSQL

### Mobile Application
1. **Authentication Flow**: JWT tokens stored securely using Expo SecureStore
2. **API Communication**: Axios-based HTTP client with automatic token injection
3. **State Management**: React Context manages authentication state across screens
4. **Navigation**: Conditional rendering between auth and main app based on authentication status
5. **Data Synchronization**: Real-time data fetching and caching for offline-capable experience
6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Shared API endpoints between web and mobile clients

## External Dependencies

- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connection for serverless environments
- **OpenAI**: AI-powered meal plan and recipe generation
- **Radix UI**: Accessible UI component primitives
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management and caching
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management and validation
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation and schema definition

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with the following setup:
- **Development Mode**: `npm run dev` - runs both client and server with hot reload
- **Production Build**: `npm run build` - builds client assets and bundles server code
- **Production Start**: `npm run start` - serves the production application
- **Database**: Uses Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL) via environment variables
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - `DATABASE_URL` for database connection
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` for AI functionality
  - `JWT_SECRET` for authentication

The build process uses Vite for client-side bundling and esbuild for server-side bundling, optimizing for production deployment with static asset serving.
